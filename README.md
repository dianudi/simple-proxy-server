# Python Simple HTTP(S) Proxy

I made a simple server HTTP (S) using Python without the 3rd library.

I used the standard library in Python to build this.
Everything goes well, maybe we need to add other features?

### How to run

1. You need a Python3.
2. Just type `python3 main.py` on Command Promt or Terminal, the port used is 5000.
3. Configure your browser or any application to use a proxy.
4. To stop, you can press ctrl + c
